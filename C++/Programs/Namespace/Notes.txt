1)What is namespace:
->Namespace provide the space where we can define or declare identifier i.e. variable,  method, classes
->Using namespace, you can define the space or context in which identifiers are defined i.e. variable, method, classes. In essence, a namespace defines a scope.


2)Synax:
namespace  namespace_name 
{
    // code declarations i.e. variable  (int a;)
    method (void add();)
    classes ( class student{};)
}

3)Advantages:
->Example, you might be writing some code that has a function called xyz() and there is another library available which is also having same function xyz(). Now the compiler has no way of knowing which version of xyz() function you are referring to within your code.
->A namespace is designed to overcome this difficulty and is used as additional information to differentiate similar functions, classes, variables etc. with the same name available in different libraries. 
->The best example of namespace scope is the C++ standard library (std) where all the classes, methods and templates are declared. Hence while writing a C++ program we usually include the directive using namespace std;
