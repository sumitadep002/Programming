Queues are widely used as waiting lists for a single shared resource like printer, disk, CPU.
Queues are used in asynchronous transfer of data (where data is not being transferred at the same rate between two processes) for eg. pipes, file IO, sockets.
Queues are used as buffers in most of the applications like MP3 media player, CD player, etc.
Queue are used to maintain the play list in media players in order to add and remove the songs from the play-list.
